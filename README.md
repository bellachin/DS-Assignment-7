# DS-Assignment-7

This code processes and analyzes air traffic passenger data to extract meaningful insights. It begins by loading a CSV dataset into a pandas DataFrame and prepares the data by converting columns to their appropriate types, including converting categorical columns to 'category' type and datetime columns to 'datetime64'. The code also handles missing values by dropping rows with specific missing data, ensuring clean data for analysis. For the visualizations, the code uses the `seaborn` and `matplotlib` libraries to create various plots, such as bar charts for passenger traffic by terminal and line charts to show annual passenger trends for domestic and international flights. Additionally, the code applies a linear regression model to predict future passenger traffic based on historical data. Python technical features used include pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for implementing the linear regression model. The use of `groupby`, `dropna`, `astype`, and `sns.regplot` are key steps for cleaning the data and generating insights through plots, showcasing Python's powerful data analysis and machine learning capabilities.
